Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. A great place to start is :doc:`/Options/justlogic`. Note that the :doc:`best starting point </Options/justcode>` is another great starting point.

For details about the hardware and code options, see :ref:`Options section for hardware and code <hardwareandcodeoptions>`.
